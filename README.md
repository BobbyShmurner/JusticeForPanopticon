# Justice For Panopticon

Hakita unrighteously took away our beloved Panopticon before we even got a chance to get to know it.

I, for one, will not stand for such injustice. So I took matters into my own hands. With this mod, you not only allow the Flesh Panopticon to live its life to its full potential, but you also get to witness our favourite little prison grow and flourish into the big and strong boss it was always destined to be ***(while it bodies you in the process).***
